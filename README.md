üìä #Data Snapshot:

Number of rows: 350
Number of columns: 18
Data source: python faker library

#Conclusion:
The overall best performing training program was Training_2 after it recorded about a 10% increase in the post training target achievement rate. the second best was traning_3 after an increase of 3% and the worst performing was training_1 with increase of just 0.9%. It is however important to know that the outcome of these training was noted not to be statistically significant but as a result of random chance.

Year by Year examination of the data show that the trainees only achieved their post training targets in 2021 with traning_2 still topping the chart after 70 trainees achieved their target while 40 failed. However, when the significance of this outcome was tested, it produced a p-value of over 80% strongly indicating that the outcome was due to random chance. This is true as 2021 is when Covid-19 restrictions and lockdown was eased leading to pending deals being finalized and closed which was then registered as part of their 2021 target.


#Recommendation:
Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendation were made:

1) The total efficiency of these training programs needs to be completely evaluated by completely taking a survey of the trainees who attended these programs not minding if they completed or not. This will help us understand if the trainees believe these programs had an effect on their efficiency or not. It's only when we have done this that we can fully know if any training program should be dropped or scraped all.

2) Conducting further analysis to explore potential factors that might contribute to the lack of statistical significance in the results. For example, we could explore demographic variables or other external factors that could impact training effectiveness.
